## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- An `UnreachableException` no longer carries the request's secrets. `Answer::send()` put the HTTP
  client's message, the whole URL with a key in its query, in its message, wrapped the client's own
  exception as its previous, and every trace of the chain kept the arguments of the calls under it
  (the query, headers and body with the key, when `zend.exception_ignore_args` is off). The message
  and the previous - now a copy of the client's exception, the same class and code - have the key's
  parameters, the URL's user part and the request's secrets masked as `***` (`Http\Redaction`),
  and no trace of the chain keeps its arguments, a 5xx's or a 429's included.
